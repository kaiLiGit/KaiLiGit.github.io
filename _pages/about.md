Once again, my name is **Kai Li**. I a fresh graduate with a undergraduate degree
in Computer Science honored with Cum Laude from [Miami University of Oxford, Ohio](https://miamioh.edu/index.html).
I once majored in management taking some introduction business classes in my first
year of college at [Palm Beach Atlantic University](https://www.pba.edu/) until the second year I transferred to Miami University, switched major to Computer Science.

To explain this transition, I had come to realize my passion in
the technological world, especially in the areas of information technology. I figured
gaining technological skills in computing will help me implement great business ideas and
turning visions into reality. My interests lie in the world of big data, data
analytics, machine learning, and all things related to data. I am aspiring to learn and
contribute in my interests fields, and hoping to apply my computing knowledge to these fields.

This website is built to showcase my projects completed during school years and leisure time.
