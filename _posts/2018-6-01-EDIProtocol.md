## Project Description: 
This projet requires me working closely with Miami University's Ecological Data Initiative (EDI) researcher, Beth <dickmaem@miamioh.edu>, to create a protocol or a documentation to utilize an R library package, [EMLassemblyline](https://github.com/EDIorg/EMLassemblyline/blob/master/documentation/instructions.md) to document the past 30 years worth of data collect from experiments done at Lakes Lacawac and Giles in Pennsylvania, USA. My responsibilities were: 
1. cleaned data by removing unnecessary data, e.g., remove columns in CSV file that violates rules enforced by the EMLAssemblyline. 
2. modified data format but not content to meet EMLAssemblyline formatting. 
3. learned the EMLAssemblyline workflow and its implementation in R. 
4. communicated with the EMLAssemblyline main contributor, [colin](https://github.com/clnsmth), for obsure error encountered when attempting to generate EML files with our existing CSV files. 
5. wrote a protocol documentation report for internal use within the Miami University's EDI community. 
6. successfully published and contributed our EDI [research data](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=186) to the EDI portal. 

## Goals: 
1. write an EDI archive protocol report for other researchers within the Miami University's EDI community to use. 
2. publish Miami University's EDI data collected from their Lake Lacawac & Giles experiments in the past 30 years. 
3. set up a weekly lab meeting with EDI student members and researchers to discuss my work in the past week. 
4. communicate with my supervisor Beth <dickmaem@miamioh.edu> to report my work progress
5. walk through the protocol report and Lake Lacawac & Giles EML file with Beth such that she understands the EML workflow which helps her with moving forward with her research. 

Ultimately, my job is to make publishing data to [EDI](https://portal.edirepository.org/) easy for researchers at Miami University's EDI and helps them contribute to the portal with ease.
