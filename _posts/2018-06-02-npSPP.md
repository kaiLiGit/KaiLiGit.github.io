## Problem
This project requires writing a research paper for _**Advanced Algorithm**_ offered at Miami University, Spring, 2018. The project requested to discuss narrowly over one specific NP-Complete problem, which
*the Set Packing Problem* (SPP) is selected for this project. Specifically, its problem description,
its variants, it applications, and the derivation proof of NP-completeness procedure were
used to broadly discuss about SPP.

## Goal
1. select one *NP-complete problem* to understand both the problem and its *NP-completeness*.
2. discover its applications relate mathematical concepts to its applications.
3. learn to prove *NP-completeness*: first prove its existence in NP, then find existed *NP-complete problem* and translate/reduce it to the problem attempting to prove.
